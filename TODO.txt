Software Plans:
Web server: 
    Uses: gevent, tornado, or twisted
    Sends data at a given interval
    starts/stops rep rap commands:
        go to home
        emergency stop
        take set of xy points on plate, go to them
        calibrate
Rep Rap control:
    Straightforward except for events/signals. Every action should be interruptible.
    Threading is obvious choice, or something like gevent. Only one thing
    is happening at a time
Imaging and analysis:
    opencv for everything
    take picture
    analyze to find colonies
Combining things:
    Combine rep rap move + imaging into convenience functions
